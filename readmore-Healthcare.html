        <h1>Artificial Intelligence: Shaping the Future</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. From simple automation to complex problem-solving, AI has rapidly evolved to become an integral part of our daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These technologies enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, interpreting images, analyzing data, and even making decisions.
        </p>
        <h2>Real-World Applications of AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling early disease detection, personalized treatment plans, and robotic-assisted surgeries. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to detect conditions like cancer or heart disease with remarkable accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Autonomous vehicles, powered by AI, are on the verge of transforming how we commute. Self-driving cars use AI to interpret sensor data and make split-second decisions to navigate safely.</li>
